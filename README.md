In this repo i will try to code 11 different sorting Algorithms and analyze them.

#Criteria for analysis:
1 - Number of Comparisons
2 - Number of swaps
3 - Adaptive
4 - Stable
5 - Extra memory

#Algorithms:
1 - Bubble sort
2 - Insertion sort
3 - Selection sort
4 - Heap sort
5 - Merge sort
6 - Quick sort
7 - Tree sort
8 - Shell sort
9 - Count sort
10 - Bucekt/Bin sort
11 - Radix sort
